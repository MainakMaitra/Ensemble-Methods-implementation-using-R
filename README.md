# Ensemble-Methods-implementation-using-R
Implementing various ensemble method techniques using R

The project relates the study of various ensemble methods implemented using the machine learning techniques like Boosting, AdaBoost, Bagging and random forest. The use of boosting methods to boost the performance of weak learners like decision stumps was implemented. Implemented bagging for decision trees (both regression and classification problems) and for KNN classifier. Used random forest for classification trees. AdaBoost, a special kind of boosting algorithm was implemented on logistic regression algorithm using different threshold values. Plotting of different graphs like: error rate as a function of boosting, bagging and random forest iterations was done to compare the results of bagging with boosting. The performances of classifier before applying ensemble methods and after applying ensemble methods were analyzed. Use of different model evaluation techniques like cross-validation, MSE, PRSS, ROC curves, confusion matrix, and out-of-bag error estimation to estimate the performance of ensemble techniques was also done.
